        In modern times it is imperative we recycle. By recycling we not only improve the dire 
        condition that our environment is in right now, but we also allow for future generations 
        to enjoy the earth just like we did. It is our duty as humans to protect Mother Nature 
        and the simplest way to do that is simply by throwing our trash away in the correct bin. 
        Now is the moment for action! Now is the moment for RecAIcle!
